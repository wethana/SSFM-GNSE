# SSFM-GNSE
Basic Split-Step Fourier Method code (Python) for solving the Generalized Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation in PM fibers

This code was written out of necessity as part of Ethan Welch's PhD thesis "Using Spike Trains of Uneven Duration and Delay (STUD pulses) to Mitigate Laser-Plasma Instabilities." 

The SSFM method is based off of G. P. Agrawal, Nonlinear Fiber Optics, sixth edition ed. (Academic Press, Cambridge, MA, 2019).
